# **Chapter One: The Dawn of Mars**

**Year 2199, TERMINUS**—Musk’s dream city, the beacon of Mars’ future.

One hundred and fifty years ago, **Elon Musk** etched his name boldly into Earth’s history. He not only paved the way to the stars but also founded a city that bridges humanity and the cosmos. **TERMINUS**, his greatest legacy on Mars, stands as an interstellar home built on the foundations of technology and courage.

Looking up from the ground, everything under the dome seems meticulously organized: the verdant glow of vertical farms intertwines with the silver-blue electric grid of the circular energy sector, like the heartbeat of human civilization pulsing in the Martian desert. The name TERMINUS signifies both an ending and a new beginning.

For 18-year-old **Mike Nova**, this city is not only home but also a cage stifling his dreams. He gazes at the shimmering stars in the night sky, his fingers unconsciously brushing the badge on his chest—a symbol of the **SPACE-X Fleet Academy**. The badge features a rocket soaring into the galaxy, with the inscription beneath it: *“Per Aspera Ad Astra”* (*Through Hardships to the Stars*).

“Mike, are you packed?”

His mother’s voice pulled him back to reality. She stood at the doorway of the living room, holding a small metallic pendant. It was a miniature rocket model, said to be a keepsake from Musk’s era, still cherished in every Martian household.

“Almost,” Mike replied, though his eyes lingered on the distant horizon beyond the dome. He could almost envision **Elon Musk** leading the first settlers onto Martian soil. Though his name has become a legend in history books, it remains vivid in the hearts of every Martian child.

Today was Mike’s farewell day. He would leave this city to join the **SPACE-X Fleet Academy** orbiting Mars and embark on his interstellar journey.
