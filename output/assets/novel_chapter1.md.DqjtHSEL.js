Located near Mars’ equator, the city is shielded by a vast transparent dome. Beneath this protective shell, the shimmering lights of countless starships rising and landing illuminate the cityscape. Every aspect of life in TERMINUS is managed by artificial intelligence and a decentralized blockchain system. Transactions and resources are seamlessly tracked through the Quantum Credit (QTC) network, ensuring efficiency and economic freedom for all residents.</p><p>For Michael, or Mike as everyone called him, this city was not just home—it was where his dreams began.</p><p>Growing Up in Terminus</p><p>Mike was born in the core district of Mars City. Both of his parents were engineers in the planetary fleet, having contributed to the development of the blockchain economy that sustained the city. From a young age, Mike was fascinated by the stories his parents told about interstellar exploration. He would often watch the towering starships launch into the skies, wondering if one day he would stand among their crew.</p><p>For Mike, freedom wasn’t just about leaving Earth. It was about venturing into the vast unknown. To him, the prestigious Planetary Fleet Academy was the key to that unknown.</p><p>The Fleet Academy Entrance Exam</p><p>At the age of 18, Mike stood on the grand plaza of the Fleet Academy, awaiting the most important moment of his life—the entrance exam. Known for its rigorous standards, the academy only accepted those who excelled in the most challenging tests of intellect, skill, and character.</p><p>The exam was divided into three sections: 1. Theoretical Test Candidates were tasked with solving a simulated galactic economy model, determining the most efficient way to manage fleet resources in a crisis. Mike’s solution surpassed the expectations of the evaluators, not only optimizing resource allocation but also proposing how Quantum Credit could be leveraged to address emergencies swiftly. 2. Practical Simulation Candidates piloted a small spacecraft through a complex space navigation trial, while simultaneously responding to a quantum virus attack on their ship’s network. Mike remained calm under pressure, successfully repairing the encrypted blockchain system and completing the mission. 3. Psychological Evaluation Presented with a life-or-death decision, Mike chose to save his teammates rather than prioritize his own survival, demonstrating his dedication to the team over individual success.</p><p>Mike passed with the highest score in the cohort, earning his place as a cadet in the academy.</p><p>The Vanguard Mission: First Assignment</p><p>Soon after joining the academy, Mike was assigned to the Vanguard Program, a high-risk experimental mission designed to explore uncharted regions of the galaxy. His assignment was to pilot the scout ship Aurora to a distant planet known as Kaspar 12 for resource sampling and environmental evaluation.</p><p>Upon reaching the planet’s orbit, the crew detected a massive wormhole emitting intense energy waves. These waves disrupted the fleet’s blockchain network, causing a sudden crash in the Quantum Credit system.</p><p>“We need to identify the source of this interference,” the fleet commander instructed over the comms.</p><p>Mike volunteered without hesitation. “Let me investigate.”</p><p>The Discovery Inside the Wormhole</p><p>Navigating cautiously, the Aurora entered the wormhole. The view outside transformed into a swirling maelstrom of light and shadow. Emerging on the other side, they found themselves near a desolate planet. Its surface was littered with ruins of an unknown architecture, radiating an ominous aura.</p><p>Exploring the ruins, Mike and his team discovered an ancient starship. Inside, they uncovered data logs revealing a chilling history. The planet had once been home to a species that fell victim to a parasitic lifeform known as the Primordial Entities. These creatures could evolve rapidly using their hosts and were capable of devastating entire civilizations.</p><p>“These coordinates… they point to Earth,” Mike murmured, staring at the logs with a sinking feeling.</p><p>A Crisis During the Retreat</p><p>As they prepared to leave, the wormhole began to destabilize. From its depths emerged shadowy, monstrous figures, accompanied by piercing shrieks. Mike realized the wormhole was not a natural phenomenon but possibly a construct created by an advanced intelligence. These entities were not here by accident—they seemed to be using the wormhole as a gateway to Mars, and perhaps, Earth itself.</p><p>“Get the Aurora running, now!” Mike shouted.</p><p>The crew fought desperately to fend off the attacking creatures while repairing the damaged blockchain system. With the ship’s engines roaring to life, they narrowly escaped back through the wormhole. As they left, Mike glanced back at the desolate planet, his mind racing with questions: Was the wormhole’s energy frequency connected to the encryption of Quantum Credit? What secrets lay behind its creation? The Beginning of a Greater Mystery</p><p>The Aurora safely returned to the fleet, but the mission’s findings were classified as top secret by the higher-ups. Information about the Primordial Entities and the wormhole was concealed from the public. Yet, Mike couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.</p><p>“Whatever lies behind that wormhole,” he muttered to himself, “we’re already caught in its web.”</p><p>Thus began the dawn of a new chapter for Mars City and a harrowing journey into the unknown.</p>',26)]))}const u=t(s,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
